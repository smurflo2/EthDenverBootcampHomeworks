don't store msg.sender in a variable
tradePercent > 0 instead of doingthe loop thing to figure it out
return the value instead of looping to set the value to a variable then returning the variable

Calldata instead of memory for params
Most things about ImportantStruct (and whitelistStruct or w/e) can be removed. Some of it's props can be reduced to uint8
